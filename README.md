# Manual-Testing-Login-Module
Manual testing project with test cases and Jira bug reports
 Manual Testing Project – Login Functionality
 
 # Project Overview
  
This project demonstrates my basic manual testing skills as a fresher.
I worked on testing a Login page to understand how software testing is done in real projects, including test case creation and bug reporting.
The goal of this project is to show my understanding of:
•	How requirements are analyzed
•	How test cases are written
•	How defects are identified and reported using JIRA

# Tools Used
•	JIRA – Bug reporting and tracking
•	MS Excel – Writing and executing test cases
•	MS Word – Bug documentation with screenshots
•	Browser – Google Chrome

  # Testing Activities Performed
✔ Requirement analysis
✔ Manual test case writing
✔ Test case execution
✔ UI validation
✔ Bug identification
✔ Bug reporting using JIRA
✔ Bug documentation with screenshots

 # Test Case Details
•	Test cases were written in Excel
•	Covered positive and negative scenarios for Login functionality

 # Each test case includes:
o	Test Case ID
o	Test Scenario
o	Test Steps
o	Test Data
o	Expected Result
o	Actual Result
o	Status (Pass/Fail)

# Bug Reporting
•	Bugs were logged in JIRA
•	Each bug includes:
o	Bug ID
o	Summary
o	Environment
o	Steps to Reproduce
o	Expected Result
o	Actual Result
o	Severity
o	Priority
o	Status
•	UI and functional bugs were documented with screenshots in Word

 # Test Environment
•	Browser: Google Chrome
•	Operating System: Windows
•	Device: Desktop

# Learning Outcome

Through this project, I learned:
•	How testers think and analyze requirements
•	How to design effective test cases
•	How bugs are reported and tracked in real tools
•	The importance of clear documentation in testing

# This is a learning-based manual testing project created to practice testing concepts and tools.
Advanced testing types like smoke, sanity, and regression are understood conceptually but not executed as part of this project.
